# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset Used
Iris Dataset

## Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis using Python to understand data patterns,
feature relationships, and important variables.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Steps Performed
- Loaded Iris dataset
- Plotted histograms for numerical features
- Analyzed categorical data using count plot
- Used box plots to identify outliers
- Created correlation heatmap
- Identified important features

## Key Insights
- Petal length and petal width are highly correlated
- Petal features are more informative than sepal features
- Dataset is clean and balanced

## Conclusion
EDA helped understand the structure and behavior of the dataset before applying
machine learning models.
